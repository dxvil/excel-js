Pure Javascript Excel project (Singe Page Application)

The coolest project i have worked on! Pure JS, own framework. 
it's giving me a lot of knowledge about OOP principles, SOlID, architecture, patterns and how the frameworks works. 
it's a level up for me as a developer, but i still have a lot of things to learn and build.
